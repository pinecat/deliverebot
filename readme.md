[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pinecat/deliverebot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pinecat/deliverebot)

This is the application for the Deliver-E-Bot at Elizabethtown College, lead by the Robotics & Machine Intelligence (RMI) Club, as well as the Green Robotics class (CS434).  The purpose of this project is to create a fully autonomous delivery robot for use on campus, specifically with the Jay's Nest in the BSC.

This codebase here is for the app students would theoretically use to place orders with the Jay's Nest for the Deliver-E-Bot to take to their dorm.  Currently, the app is being developed in React Native, for cross-platform compatibility.  The app can run on iOS, Android, or even in a web browser on your computer.  [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).

There is dev server used for testing purposes that has been setup.  You can access it [here](http://botdev.etown.edu).  For SSH or other authenticated access to the server, please contact Rory.

This app is being updated all the time, so check back regularly for more updates! :D
